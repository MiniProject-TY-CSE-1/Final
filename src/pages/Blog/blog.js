      description: ` Virabhadrasana I, also known as Warrior Pose I, is a fundamental yoga pose that is part of many yoga traditions, including Hatha, Vinyasa, and Ashtanga yoga. This pose is named after the mythical warrior Virabhadra, created by Lord Shiva in Hindu mythology. Virabhadrasana I is a standing pose that is known for its strength-building and grounding benefits, as well as its capacity to enhance focus, balance, and flexibility.

      description: `Also Known As: Warrior Angle (Virabhadra Konasana)

      Targets: Legs, hips, hamstrings, chest-opener
      
      Level: Beginner
      
      Extended Side Angle Pose is often taught in Vinyasa flow classes as part of a standing sequence. It is a great opportunity to deepen into a classic shape with a focus on balance, breath, and extending through the side body. You might also use it to prepare for poses that have a wide groin spread, such as Bound Angle Pose or Wide-Angle Seated Forward Fold Pose.`,

      description:
        "As part of the Sun Salutation sequence, Standing Forward Bend (also known as Uttanasana) is done often in Vinyasa-style practice. In that sequence, it is performed both near the beginning and at the end. Do not rush through this bend, especially because forward bends allow your body to release more deeply over a longer hold time. Standing Forward Bend stretches and lengthens the hamstrings and calves.",

      description: `Also Known As: Standing half forward bend, flat back

      Targets: Hamstrings, calves, torso
      In Sanskrit, Ardha Uttanasana means "intense half stretch pose." The pose certainly gives your hamstrings a great stretch, but it also encourages good spinal alignment. Forward bends also stimulate your abdominal organs and promote good digestion.`,

      description: `Also Known As: Intense Side Stretch Pose, Intense Flank Stretch Pose

      Targets: Hamstrings, shoulders
      Pyramid Pose is one of those poses where you can really see the results of consistent practice. It's also a great warmup for any hamstring intensive poses that you might have planned. Keeping your hands on the floor or on blocks at first will prevent tipping over. It's OK to widen your stance toward the sides of your mat for the same reason. Later, you can start to incorporate your core strength more by lifting your hands off the floor and narrowing your stance.`,

      description: `This pose improves posture, strengthens the legs, and provides a full body stretch. If you've ever gotten out of bed in the morning and had a long languorous stretch, that's basically urdhva hastasana. But just as Mountain Pose is a lot more than just standing around, doing raised hands pose correctly requires attention to detail. In push-pull opposition, some parts of the body move down while others move up, taking this stretch to the next level.`,

This should put you into a forward lunge position. Place your hands on your forward knee. Keep your shoulders relaxed, your hips even, your chest open, and your gaze straight ahead.
      Press down with your hands and drive the hips forward until you feel a stretch from the front of your hip, groin, and thigh on your left side.
      Hold the stretch for about 20 to 30 seconds.

      Begin to shift your weight into your right foot, lifting your left foot off the floor. Keep your right leg straight but don't lock the knee.
      Bend your left knee and bring the sole of your left foot high onto your inner right thigh. 
      Press your foot into your thigh and your thigh back into your foot with equal pressure. This will help you keep both hips squared toward the front so your right hip doesn't jut out.
      Focus your gaze (Drishti) on something that doesn't move to help you keep your balance.
      Take 5 to 10 breaths, then lower your left foot to the floor and do the other side.`,

      Sit with your legs extended straight in front of you. Sit on your sit bones as much as possible. To that end, take hold of the flesh of each buttock and move it out of the way. This results in a much more grounded feeling.
      Engage your thigh muscles and flex both feet. Your heels may come up off the floor, but do your best to keep them rooted on the mat for engagement. Bend at the knees if needed.
      Stack the shoulders directly on top of the hips. Release your shoulders away from your ears.
      Hold your arms straight and palms flat on the floor on either side of your hips to support your spine. However, arm lengths vary so there is some discretion to bend your arms slightly or shift the placement of your palms.
      Inhale to lengthen your spine.

      Stretching the hips and inner thighs in Baddha Konasana can begin to counteract the effects of spending too much time sitting at a desk or in a car. It will also help prepare you for other meditative seated poses, which require good flexibility in the hips and groin.`,
